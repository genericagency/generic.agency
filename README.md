# Generic Agency: A Performative Digital Agency

## High Level Concept

Generic Agency (stylised as “generic|digital”) is a satirical commentary on the widespread, systemic issues currently present within the mass communication industry.

While many agencies - both boutique and fledgling alike - are now touting themselves as “full service digital agencies” or “integrated communication consultancies” - many seem to be more sure that these buzzwords will get the right set of eyeballs on them, without being sure of their ability to deliver or worse yet, what any of the words mean separately and let alone strung together.

## Call for Submissions

@maoventures proudly presents **Agency Horror Stories**, an accumulation of horror stories compiled anonymously by anyone who's had Agency Horror Stories of their own.

Our hope is to start *real* conversations about these issues rather than having greasy old CEOs who refuse to read anything beyond the tabloids whine about *"team inefficiencies"*.

Our hope is to educate the standard consumer who may not be aware of the realities of integrated communication services as well as the dark side of performance-based marketing.

## Why did we make this?

Upon announcing the Malaysian DIgital Blueprint 2021, Malaysia is estimated to be at least 8 to 15 years behind the Global standards of DIgital Adoption. This has been propagated by agencies who profit by leveraging on their clients ignorance.

> it is safe to say that generic|digital may prove to be a scandalously, spicier read 50 shades of gray on the scene.

## Goals

1. To create open discourse and conversation surrounding the systemic issues present within the advertising, marketing and communications agencies and their shared mindset.
2. Educate the average consumer about the actual mechanics behind the service offerings presented to them, allowing them to make an informed choice prior to selecting a service provider.
3. To serve as a platform for consumer education, constructive commentary through satire of the stereotype of a boutique/independent agency in Malaysia today.

## Target Audience Demographic

1. The average consumer looking to employ an external digital agency, whether it’s your multi-national conglomerate/brand or the company that has scaled and wants to outsource either their marketing, public relations or advertising needs.
2. The agency owners who may be forced to do some reflection or company analysis - if insecure enough, that is - if they fear being the subject of a post, campaign or ad set for generic|digital moving forward.

## Important Brand Channels

1. Website (built on a no-code platform/builder that would still beat their versions of wordpress.org any day)
2. Blog (hosted on Medium, linked through a custom subdomain)
3. Social Media Channels: Instagram, Facebook Page, LinkedIn Page
